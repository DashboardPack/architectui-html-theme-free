## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
Download and Uncompress the theme package archive in your desired folder location.

Download and install Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install the app dependencies by running the following command in the command line inside the folder root where you have unzipped the theme package archive.

```bash
npm install
```

After npm finishes installing the modules from package.json you can go ahead and start the application. To do so, run the command below.

```bash
npm run start
```

After the command finished, you should see a **Compiled successfully!** message in your terminal window. Also, a web server service will be started so you can view your app in the browser: **http://localhost:8080**

### Production Build
To create a production optimized build run the command below:

```bash
npm run build
```

This created another folder in the root of your project named build. You'll have an option to start a local web server to view your newly created production build.
